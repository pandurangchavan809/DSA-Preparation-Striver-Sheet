// Task Scheduler :

/*
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.

Input :  tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output :  8
Explanation : One valid execution order is:
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
Total intervals = 8


Input :  tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
Output : 6
 Explanation A possible execution:
A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B
No idle interval is needed as cooldown = 1.
